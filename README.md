## Contributing or using from Source
Apologies, but this thing has the ltngsharing__ namespace used throughout.  You'll need to get rid of that, and remove it from the testdata and project.json file if you want to work on the source, deploy to a scratch org, or use the unpackaged version in production.

I need to make some tooling for doing a build with/without namespace, but haven't yet.
